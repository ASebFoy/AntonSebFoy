# 👋 Hi, I'm Anton

🎓 I'm a Master's student in Information Systems Management with a growing focus on cybersecurity and AI strategy. I'm building a technical foundation through labs and projects while developing broader skills in digital trust, governance, and secure system design.

## 🧠 Currently Working On
- CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification
- Cybersecurity labs focused on email spoofing, encryption, and trust models
- Building a GitHub portfolio to showcase applied security knowledge

## 🔧 Skills & Tools
`Windows` `Wireshark` `GPG` `Kleopatra`  
`Git` `GitHub` `VS Code`  
`Python` `Go (Golang)`  
`Scrum` `Project Management`  
`TryHackMe (in progress)`

## 💼 Cybersecurity Projects
- 🕵️‍♂️ [MITM Simulation with SMTP Spoofing](https://github.com/AntonSebFoy/mitm-simulation) — Simulated forged email communication over localhost using hMailServer and Thunderbird to explore spoofing vulnerabilities
- 🎭 [PGP Key Spoofing Demo](https://github.com/AntonSebFoy/pgp-key-spoofing) — Demonstrated social engineering and trust flaws in PGP public key infrastructure using fake identities and signature manipulation
- 🤖 **In Development** — Master's thesis project: designing an interactive phishing simulation and training platform powered by AI-generated emails, with dynamic difficulty and feedback

## 🚀 Goals
- Gain hands-on experience in threat simulation, encryption, and AI-aligned cybersecurity
- Pursue internships and future roles in cyber policy, SOC, or security strategy
- Keep learning and documenting to bridge technical depth with strategic thinking
